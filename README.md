# Machine Learning Project - Unsupervised Learning

## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.

- To seperate customers into groups based on their spending habits over 5 types of products:
  * Fresh
  * Milk
  * Grocery
  * Frozen
  * Detergents Paper
  * Delicassen

to presumable to gain insights through the unsupervised ML model as to consumer spending patterns for business application.


## Project Steps:
### Part I - EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing to clean raw data, understand correlations and transforma data as necessary

### Part II - KMeans Clustering
Using KMeans Clustering to analyze data

### Part III - Hierarchical Clustering
Using Hierarchical Clustering to analyze data

### Part IV - PCA
To determine conclusions from Principal Component Analysis

### Part V - Conclusion
4 major conclusion points for the entire model


## Documents
notebook.ipynb - contains the ML model and all necessary code to run
Wholesale_Data.csv - original wholesale data used to train model
UnsupervisedLearning-Project - original project instructions (used for reference and can be largely ignored)


## Future Considerations
Given more resources and time for this project, it would be helpful to explore the parameters of which the model could be run. There was potential to cluster products together even more and simplify the model. Given the time, this should be explored to see how it would affect the number of customer clusters produced.
